# Which Metrics To Monitor ?

* Server Stats
* Proxy Server Stats
* Network Dump
* Process Monitoring Metrics

### Server Stats

 Type | Description
------------ | -------------
CPU Stats    | To monitor CPU metrics (user,system,io)
Disk Stats	 | Get the Metrics from /proc/diskstats
FileSystem Stats | Storage system used
loadavg 	 | Get the Metrics from /proc/loadavg to identify the workload for the last 15min
netstat	 | Active Internet connections (only servers)
meminfo 	 | Memory related metrics of server to identify memory issues
filefd	 | Exposes file descriptor statistics from /proc/sys/fs/file-nr 

### Proxy Server Stats
Type | Description
------------ | -------------
Inbound Traffic | The number of bytes sent from client/endpoints to backend web server through the SSL-Offloading Server
Outbound Traffic	 | Get the Metrics from /proc/diskstats
Open Connections | The number of connections open at the given sample moment.
Closed Connections per second	 | To track TCP Closed Connections
Round trip time	 | RTT measured for each connection between client and SSL-Offloading Server

### Network Dump

### Process Monitoring Metrics
* Prometheus custom exporter (Python Code which could check the aliveness of the process and report it to the promethues server)
* Nagios for the process monitoring.

How to we do it ?
------
* **Server Stat** : 
  * The method i here use is using promtheus and node exporter.
   [Please Click here to know how to do it](/node_exporter_and_prometheus)
* **Proxy Monitoring Stat** : 
  * There are several methods i use here Nginx Vts Exporter.
  [Please Click here to know how to do it](/nginx_vts_exporter_prometheus)
    * Other Exporters:
        * HAProxy Exporter
        * F5 Exporter
        * Netscalar Exporter 
        * Squid Exporter
**Process Monitoring Metrics**
  * Nagios for Exporters (Monitoring & Proxy server Exporters)
  * Python custom exporter to get the process and feed it to the endpoint where prometheus could scrape the metrics.

Key Metrics for Alert setup in a SSL Ofloading Server
----
* CPU load - Peak CPU Utilization could sacrifice the SSL Ofloading process using OOM killer.
* Increase in file descriptor - This causes slower responses and higher wait time will cause high FDâ€™s on server.
* SSL Certificate Expiry on the Proxy Server
 * CN match check
 * Days to expiry 
* Memory Free
* SSL-Offloading Proxy Server Process Aliveness (With Nagios/ Promethues)

Challenges of SSL-Offloading Proxy Server Monitoring
----------
* Internet Facing Firewall Monitoring : Catch Security Threats, DDoS attacks , Spoofing
* HA of the monitoring, Need to make sure Monitoring stack is always running with zero downtime.
* Authenticity of the monitoring Data.
* Key Sizes of Requests - It will eat up the CPU during SSL offloading.
